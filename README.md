<a href="https://www.mainframeops.com/">mainframeOps/mfops</a> is built to provide resources, guides, cheatsheets, and insights for working with mainframes and cloud technologies. This platform started as a way to document my learning journey in mainframes and cloud technologies as part of my final school project, where I aimed to combine my skills in cloud tech,mainframes, and modern web practices. Now, it aims to be a collaborative resource where others can contribute and new learners can easily navigate and benefit. </p>
